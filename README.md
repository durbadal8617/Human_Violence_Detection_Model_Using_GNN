# Human_Violence_Detection_Model_Using_GNN
A hybrid YOLO + MediaPipe + GNN + LSTM based real-time violence detection model. It extracts human poses, bounding boxes, and temporal features to classify video frames as violence or non-violence with high stability using EMA smoothing and attention mechanisms.
