#  Violence Detection Model (YOLO + GNN + LSTM)

A hybrid deep learning architecture designed for **real‑time human violence detection** using a powerful combination of:

* **YOLOv8** for person & object detection
* **MediaPipe Pose** for human keypoint extraction
* **GAT‑based Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)** for pose graph encoding
* **Bi‑LSTM + Attention** for temporal understanding
* **EMA smoothing** for stable, consistent predictions

This model is optimized for real‑time inference, smooth probability curves, and high interpretability.

##  Features

### Hybrid Multi‑Modal Architecture**

* Combines **bounding boxes**, **pose keypoints**, and **graph embeddings**.
* Learns both spatial pose relations and temporal motion patterns.

### Accurate Violence Classification

* Frame‑wise classification into **Violence** or **Non‑Violence**.
* Optional **proximity gating** to prevent false positives.

### Stable Predictions

* Uses **Exponential Moving Average (EMA)** smoothing.
* Weighted hybrid probability formula for non‑violence.

### Streamlit Interface

* Real‑time frame display.
* Live probability bar.
* Detected persons, weapons, and pose graphs.
* Full video statistics + downloadable CSV.
